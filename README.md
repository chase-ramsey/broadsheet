# Broadsheet

**Broadsheet** is a simple news aggregator that fetches RSS data from a handful of preselected media outlets and renders them in an easy-to-browse layout. Users can create profiles, subscribe to any of the preselected feeds the app provides, add new feeds using the RSS subscribe links for any outlet of their choice, save articles for later reference, and talk with other users about interesting stories.

### Run
After forking the repository, you'll need to get Bower and NPM initialized in the project root folder. Then, you can install the developer dependencies that will allow the app to run.
