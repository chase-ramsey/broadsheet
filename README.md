# Broadsheet

**Broadsheet** is a simple news aggregator that fetches RSS data from a handful of preselected media outlets and renders them in an easy-to-browse layout. Users can create profiles, subscribe to any of the preselected feeds the app provides, add new feeds using the RSS subscribe links for any outlet of their choice, save articles for later reference, and talk with other users about interesting stories.
